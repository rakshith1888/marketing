              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA RESIDENTS NOTICE</h2>

              <p>
                We offer our Platform and services within the European Union and therefore the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") applies. This notice applies to you if you are resident in the European Economic Area ("EEA": the countries of the European Union as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) ("GDPR notice").
              </p>

              <p>
                Therefore, if you are located in the EEA, the general considerations in the Policy and the considerations specifically set out in this GDPR notice will apply. If there is a conflict between the Policy and the GDPR notice and this GDPR notice applies to you, then the GDPR notice will prevail.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unless otherwise specified, definitions in this EU Supplemental Terms will have the same meaning as the definitions used in the Terms of Use.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Processors And International Data Transfers</h3>

              <p>
                Insofar as third parties process your personal data on our behalf, they do so as processors as defined in the GDPR. In these cases, we are the data controller, as we determine the purposes and means of data processing. We will only engage processors who adequately implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and who guarantee the protection of your rights. In order to ensure this, we enter into data processing agreements with our processors. This is compulsory under the GDPR. The data processing agreement regulates, among other things, data security, confidentiality and your rights.
              </p>

              <p>
                If your personal data are transferred to 'third countries' – i.e., countries outside the EEA – we will only do so if the third country offers an adequate level of protection. In some countries outside the EEA – please, check here – your personal data are sufficiently protected in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. If this is not the case, we provide appropriate safeguards to ensure adequate data protection. For example, by using the most recent standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission and by implementing additional safeguards.
              </p>

              <p>
                If no appropriate safeguards are in place, we will only transfer your personal data if a legal exception applies. An example of a legal exception is explicit consent.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">When And How Do We Request Consent?</h3>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-6 mb-3">1. Collecting and sharing your personal data</h4>

              <p>
                As set out in the Policy, we may collect your personal data from other sources and we may share your personal data with affiliated companies, group companies and subsidiaries, third-party services providers and marketing partners. In these cases and to the extent that the receiving party is not a processor on our behalf, we will only collect or share your personal data if we have obtained your consent. This consent is obtained for example via a consent banner or a cookie banner depending on the receiving party.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-6 mb-3">2. Marketing purposes</h4>

              <p>
                We will not use your electronic contact details for marketing purposes, unless you are our customer or meet another exception under the applicable telecommunications laws. As mentioned in the Policy, you can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send (this is also called 'OPT OUT'). If you are not our existing customer, we will ask for your consent to send direct marketing messages (this is also called 'OPT IN').
              </p>

              <p>
                For the underlying processing of your personal data for marketing purposes, we may process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, except when your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our interests. This legal basis is referred to below as 'legitimate interest'.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-6 mb-3">3. Special categories of personal data</h4>

              <p>
                Our Platform does not intend to collect special categories of personal data, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs. However, we cannot fully guarantee that we will not collect such data if you provide it to us.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Additional Privacy Rights</h3>

              <p>
                If you are a resident of the EEA, you may invoke a number of privacy rights additional to those mentioned in the Policy, which are the right to review or change the information in your account to make sure it is accurate and up-to-date. The additional rights include:
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Erasure.</strong> You generally have a right to erasure; however, we may not always erase your personal data because sometimes the processing is still necessary: for example, for complying with statutory obligations or for lodging, exercising or substantiating legal claims. Therefore, we will weigh your interest in having your personal data erased against the necessity of maintaining the personal data for other legitimate interests. Regarding the deactivation of your account we refer to the information mentioned in the Policy.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing.</strong> Under certain circumstances, you may have us restrict the processing of your personal data. For example, if the accuracy of your personal data are contested.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Notification of Rectification, Deletion or Restriction.</strong> Unless it is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort, we will inform the recipients of your personal data about rectification, deletion or restriction of processing.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Data Portability.</strong> Under certain circumstances, you may request us to transfer your personal data to another party.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right of Objection.</strong> Furthermore, under certain circumstances you may object to the processing of your personal data by us (or third parties engaged by us). For example, you may object to the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent.</strong> If we have requested your consent for data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right of Complaint.</strong> If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates applicable laws and regulations, please contact us at hello@groflexerp.com. We will always try to find a solution together. Should this not be possible, you can lodge a complaint with any competent authority in the European Union, or to take legal action.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">How to exercise these rights and what we may need from you?</h3>

              <p>
                You can submit your request(s) for exercising these rights to us at hello@groflexerp.com, please provide your name, telephone number, and type of request. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request(s). Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your personal data. For example, if you make a request, we will ask you to confirm your name, email address, and/or other information we in our records to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data are not disclosed to someone who has no right to receive it.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will respond to your request as soon as possible, and no later than one month from receipt of your request.

If a longer period of up to two months is needed, we will inform you within one month of receipt of the request. The submission and processing of your request is free of charge, unless your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of a repetitive character.

                In the 12 months preceding the Last Updated date of this Notice, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose as described above:
              </p>

              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Categories of Information "Sold"</h3>

              <p>
                We do not sell your personal data for a monetary fee; however, some U.S. privacy laws define a "sale" very broadly such that it may include our sharing of your personal data with certain third parties if we receive anything of value in return. In that regard, we share your personal data with certain third-party marketing partners and in exchange we receive the ability to market or offer our products and services through their websites and applications. This may be considered a "sale" under some laws.
              </p>

              <p>
                The personal data that may be shared or sold in this context is: your name; email address; other contact information; and information obtained through cookies about, for example, your location, the website that directed you to our Platform, how you navigate our sites, and what purchases you make.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our use of tracking technologies may be considered a "sale" under California law; however, we do not knowingly sell the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. The categories of personal information shared or sold in this context are:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Category A: Identifiers.</li>
                <li>Category D: Commercial information.</li>
                <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity.</li>
                <li>Category G: Geolocation data.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The categories of third parties with which personal information collected via tracking technologies was shared or sold are: advertisers and marketing partners, data analytics providers, and social media networks.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Do-Not-Track Features</h3>

              <p>
                Many web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a "do-not-track" feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing do-not-track signals has been finalized and, as such, we do not currently respond to do not track browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. We will update this Policy if that changes in the future.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Additional Privacy Rights</h3>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Information.</strong> Subject to certain limits, you may ask us to provide the following information for the 12-month period preceding your request:

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Delete.</strong> You also have the right to ask us to delete any personal information that we have collected about you, subject to certain limitations. We may deny your deletion request if the information is necessary for us or our service providers to, among other things, provide a service you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated in the context of our business relationship with you, perform a contract we have with you, detect and protect against security incidents or illegal activity, comply with a legal obligation, or exercise a right provided for by law.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Opt Out of Sale.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. You may exercise this right by clicking on the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information – U.S." by submitting a request as described in the "Submission of Requests" section below.

Please note that your use of our website may still be tracked by us and/or our service providers.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Right to Nondiscrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights under any applicable privacy law, including by:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Denying you goods or services.</li>

              </ul>

              <p>
                We are permitted under applicable law to offer you certain financial incentives that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels, which are related to your personal information's value. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Submission of Requests.</strong> You may submit a request regarding your personal information by:
