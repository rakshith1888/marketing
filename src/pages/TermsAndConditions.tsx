                  All other users, please read this section carefully. It affects your rights. You agree that by entering into these Terms, you and we are each waiving any right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. You and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.

                <p>
                  <strong>Governing Law.</strong> All claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of the Platform, shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Delaware without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are expressly excluded by these Terms. The parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the "Agreement to Binding Arbitration" provision below. For any claim, dispute, or other legal proceeding not subject to the "Agreement to Binding Arbitration" provision below, the claim or dispute shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located within Kent County, Delaware or the federal courts in the District of Delaware, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Informal Negotiations.</strong> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party. You may provide notice to us using the information provided in the "CONTACT US" section below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Agreement to Binding Arbitration.</strong> Subject to the Exceptions to Arbitration set forth below, you and we each agree that any and all disputes between Platform users arising under or related in any way to these Terms and such users' use of the Platform must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. With the exception of the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" section, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate will still apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration.</strong> This Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply to the following: (a) small claims court cases; (b) legal proceedings that involve efforts to obtain user identifying information; (c) any legal proceedings brought against the Company by companies or other legal entities or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities; (d) any legal proceedings brought by the Company against companies or other legal entities or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; (e) a party's right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; or (f) where the application of this provision is prohibited by applicable law. If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in this DISPUTE RESOLUTION section cannot be enforced, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate will not apply. Where this Agreement to Arbitrate does not apply, the remainder of this Agreement and the Dispute Resolution section will continue to apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this section, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA's rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at www.adr.org. Any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules at the time the arbitration is commenced, the arbitration shall be held in Dover, Delaware. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, you and we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or we may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Platform user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                <p>
                  <strong>Limitation to Assert a Claim.</strong> In no event shall any Dispute be commenced more than one (1) year after the facts giving rise to the claim occurred.

                  Last Updated: June 23, 2024
                </p>
                <p>
                  We offer our Platform and services within the European Union. These supplemental terms of use apply to you if you are a resident of the European Union ("EU Supplemental Terms").
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, if you are residing in the European Union, the general Terms of Use and these EU Supplemental Terms will apply. If there is any conflict between the Terms of Use and these EU Supplemental Terms, and these EU Supplemental Terms apply to you, then the EU Supplemental Terms will prevail.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unless otherwise specified, definitions in this EU Supplemental Terms will have the same meaning as the definitions used in the Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prior to the creation of your account, the text of these Terms of Use will be made available to you electronically via the Platform in such a manner that it can be easily stored by you on a durable data carrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to the Terms of Use or these EU Supplemental Terms at any time. We will inform you about any changes before the effective date of the changes. If you continue to use the Platform after the effective date of the changes, you will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted the changes in any revised Terms or EU Supplemental Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong><br />

                </p>
                <p>
                  Provided that you are eligible to use the Platform, you are granted, solely for the purpose of execution of your account, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Platform, the Content and the Marks. This license is given for the duration of your account and you hereby accept this license. We are at all times entitled to terminate this license unilaterally, early and with immediate effect, without having to pay you any compensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You indemnify us against any loss arising from any infringement of Intellectual Property Rights by you in respect of the Platform. You will compensate us for all costs and loss, including the costs of legal assistance, arising from a violation of Intellectual Property Rights. You will take measures at your own expense in order to limit the costs to be incurred and/or loss to be suffered by us.

                <p>
                  <strong>Fees and Payment</strong><br />
