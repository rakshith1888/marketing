If there is any conflict between the Terms of Use and these EU Supplemental Terms, and these EU Supplemental Terms apply to you, then the EU Supplemental Terms will prevail.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Prior to the creation of your account, the text of these Terms of Use will be made available to you electronically via the Platform in such a manner that it can be easily stored by you on a durable data carrier.
