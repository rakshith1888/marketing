              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">WHICH COOKIES DO WE USE?</h2>

              <p>
                We select our Cookies carefully. We work with certain third parties to collect data through Cookies, but we are neither responsible nor liable for the processing of personal data by these third parties, and can therefore not guarantee that these third parties will handle your personal data in a reliable and secure manner. You should always read the privacy and Cookie policies of other websites or tools before using them. If you want to know more about Cookies in general, please refer to the website all about Cookies.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to Cookies, we also use tracking and other technologies that can be very similar. Our Site may contain small transparent image files or codes that record information about you. These are, for example, 'scripts', 'web beacons' or 'tracking URLs'. These technologies are also referred to as Cookies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Below we explain, among other things, which types of Cookies we use and for what purposes.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">ESSENTIAL COOKIES</h3>

              <p>
                These Cookies are essential for our Site's core activity and are automatically activated when you use the Site. These Cookies are for example used to remember your account details, your selected language settings and your previous searches, so that you can use our Site efficiently and effectively. These Cookies also include the enabling of essential security and accessibility features so that you can safely use our Site. We also save your permission settings in a Cookie to remember these for future visits.
              </p>

              <p>
                We may use these essential Cookies without your consent. Because these Cookies are necessary for the Site to work, you cannot opt out of this category. However, the Cookies will never be used for any purpose other than ensuring the functionality of our Site.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">ANALYTICAL COOKIES</h3>

              <p>
                These Cookies help improve the performance of the Site and provide a better user experience. This enables us to offer you a high quality experience by adapting our Site and content and identifying and resolving problems quickly. For example, we use performance Cookies to monitor which pages are most popular, which method of navigation between pages is the most effective, and to ascertain why some pages receive error notifications.
              </p>

              <p>
                We also use Google Analytics. When enabled, Google will collect visitation information and associate it with Google information from accounts of signed-in users who have consented to this association for the purpose of analytics and personalization. This Google information may include the end user location, search history, YouTube history, and data from sites that partner with Google, and is used to provide us aggregated and anonymized insights into our users' cross device behaviors. We therefore see global statistics and anonymized data.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can read more about Google Analytics here (English), and also opt out of Google Analytics at any time here (English). Your data with Google may be accessed or deleted via My Activity. You can also refuse these Cookies by changing your browser settings. Please refer to the section "HOW CAN I CONTROL COOKIES?". Should anything change with regard to the rules on the use of Google Analytics, we will adjust our use accordingly.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">MARKETING AND TRACKING COOKIES</h3>

              <p>
                We collaborate with third parties to display advertisements on our Site or to manage advertisements on other sites. Those third parties can use technologies such as Cookies to collect information about your activities on this Site and other sites in order to offer you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. You can refuse these First-Party and Third-Party Cookies by changing your browser settings. Please refer to the section "HOW CAN I CONTROL COOKIES?".
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, Google may not share your information with other advertisers. If required, they may share this information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process or governmental requests.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS</h3>

              <p>
                Our Site may contain buttons, widgets, tools or content that link to services from other companies (for example, Facebook 'like' or 'share' buttons). We may collect information about your use of these functions. In addition, when you see or use these buttons, tools or content, or if you view a web page that contains these, certain information from your browser can be sent to the other company automatically.
