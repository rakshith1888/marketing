Replace the placeholder divs in `index.php` and `page-products.php`:

```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<div class="dashboard-preview">
    <div class="dashboard-placeholder">
        ðŸ“Š Dashboard Preview
    </div>
</div>

<!-- With this -->
<div class="dashboard-preview">
    <img src="path-to-your-screenshot.jpg" alt="GrofleX Dashboard" />
    <!-- OR -->
    <video autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="path-to-your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>
```

### Using Shortcodes

The theme includes custom shortcodes for easy content management:

#### CTA Button
```
[groflex_cta text="Get Started" url="/trial" style="primary"]
```

#### Feature Card
```

Your feature description here
[/groflex_feature_card]
